# Renametron-2000
Have you ever experienced suicidal thoughts because you had to rename 250 files all at once when none of them are even in the same folder? Is the repetitive task of renaming files a bi-monthly inconvenience to you? Are you looking for an easy solution coming from a less-than-reliable source?
Well look no more because I have quite the treat for you let me tell you that! 
Here at Gholiz, inc. we take rename-induced suicide very seriously!

This bleeding edge piece of software ingenuity uses state-of-the-art Python modules such as REGEX and OS to look for user-specified patterns within all file names inside subdirectories of a given folder and replace every single one of them with another user-specified string.

Now you might find yourself wondering "What if I accidentally run this directly in one of my drives? It sounds like it could easily corrupt every single file on that drive when I just wanted to rename the ones that were directly inside it", and to that I say, don't worry, I've got you covered, this program has a built-in safety protocol that only lets you execute it if it receives a parent directory address that's at least three folders deep inside a drive, that way you can rest easy knowing not every single one of your installed programs will stop working as soon as you run this code.

Other built-in safety features include an entire if statement dedicated to making sure that the target pattern that the user inputs doesn't include any regular expression metacharacters (except for . which is relatively safe to use) to prevent unexpected results and even if it does include REGEX it will only be executed after the user has been made aware of the potential dangers that await them.




Just for the record, I'm being satirical.
